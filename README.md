## Simple UI Test and Unit Test Sample App
This app shows how to implement UITest and Unit Tests into a Xamarin.Forms project.

The UITest follows the recommended practice of Page Object testing. In the Views, we've added `StyleId` to each control to show how UITest can interact with controls using their StyleIDs.

The UnitTests project includes a sample iOS unit test.
